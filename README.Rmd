Title: Skyddsvärda träd visualsation with shiny
---

# Idea

This is my shiny dashboard app to visualize the results of the inventory of protected trees from Jonkoping county.

# Background 

The database of protected trees in Jonkoping county consits to date (march 2019) of around 160 000 observations of
valuable trees. There exists data on tree circumference, type of tree, health of tree as well as in which municipality
the tree is located.

# Data and code

The code as well as the data is stored in this repository. If you want to see the Shiny app in action head over to
